I think it's super important for users to be able to dive into the data themselves, not always having to go through an analyst for support -- this helps us be more ""data-minded"" as a company and hopefully drives better decision-making at all levels of the organization.","With the flexibility Looker gives its users, there's also some risk that people less familiar with the data and what/how it's measuring will misinterpret what they see. I'm not sure how the tool itself can help avoid these issues (clear definitions, process for validation, etc?) but that would be something nice to see. Even as someone who uses Looker regularly, when I'm in an unfamiliar Explore I have a hard time knowing what dimensions are available and applicable to my purpose and how they ought to be used.

Otherwise, I'm generally very excited about having one unified BI tool as the current split between Domo and Looker is a pain!",2,1,2,2,2,2,2,-1,

Domo is great for finding data, for filtering data to what you want and making a simple visualisation to explain your point.","Finding the data we need can be difficult. I have been trying to help a few guys build stuff, and although it is relatively simple for me to find things, they are finding it difficult.  It's almost as if we need a map of which datasets hold what data.  I do think we need to remember that, as easy as it is, not everyone has an interest in using a computer or really understands how to use them, and I think it will be a long time until that changes.  We need to ensure that we present things in a simple easy to digest fashion.

Also I find a lot of data that exists in multiple flows, I often wonder if it would be better if we just had 1 flow with all the data, obviously we can't do this as some data is sensitive, I do think the GOLD flows are a good way to go but I think we need more clarification on what is where.

I have always felt that we need standardisation, we have too many cards/dashboards saying the same thing but are different.  Globally we need to setup our key metrics, on-time, quality, H&S and cost, maybe a few others, and these are setup for each site and can not be changed they're our driving metrics.  Then you can have some lower level stuff, service line, departmental and that sort of thing, these would also not be changed and would go into more departmental information.  These first 2 are the same across all sites and would mean that anyone can look at any area and know what the situation is.  Then you have an individuals investigation for their own projects, the audience for this would not be big, maybe just an individual, the data can be used for process improvements/engineering decisions but that is where it stays.

I also feel that data input is a challenge, we are very reliant on a manual input to let us know what is going on, as difficult as it is to say, humans are fallible, especially when you are dealing with large volumes of data.  We need to automate a lot more, not just on the shopfloor but at the front end of the business too.
